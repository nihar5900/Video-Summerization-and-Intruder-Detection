# Video-Summerization-and-Intruder-Detection
Extract key-frame and detect intruder
Video summary is a method for breaking up lengthy videos into manageable chunks. The suggested approach makes use of keyframe extraction, shot detection, scene detection, and deep learning algorithms. The proposed 
method is tested on a real-world dataset, and the results show that it outperforms traditional techniques. Aims to use machine learning to video summarization for intruder detection by employing multiple deep learning models for keyframe extraction, then sum up the result as summarized
footage and verify if there is an intruder or not in the frame using facial recognition. Consequently, it will be valuable for real-time analysis and security.
